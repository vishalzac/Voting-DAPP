# Voting-DAPP
This is the solidity decenteralised voting system code. 
The system administrator has the authority to begin, end, and view the results of voting.
First the ultimate voter registers themselves using their adhaar card, and in exchange, 
they receive a unique id. When all voters have registered, the administrator will activate the voting system on election day.
All voters must adhere to the protocol and cast their ballots only once.
Finally, the administrator will stop voting and declare the outcome, which will be provided by the Ethereum network.
